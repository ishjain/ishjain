### About Me ðŸ‘‹
I am Ish Jain, PhD student at UC San Diego, interested in cutting-edge research in the next generation of wireless networks. My research advances the field of millimeter-wave networks by designing new architectures (e.g., Delay-phased array), new algorithms (e.g. Two beams are better than one), and new analysis (e.g. stochastic geometry).

### About my public repos
I love to open-source my code, datasets, and other artifacts to help others advance research in these areas. I quickly respond to any queries on the artifacts and am always excited to discuss new ideas. Just send an email to ikjain@ucsd.edu if you are interested in my work.

Here is a brief description of some of the public repos.

1. [Mobile](https://github.com/ucsdwcsng/mMobile): A public dataset for 3D complex mmWave channel across time, frequency, and space dimensions. This dataset can be used to understand mobility and beam management challenges in mmWave networks.

2. [mmReliable](https://github.com/ucsdwcsng/mmreliable): Code for Sigcomm'21 paper [Two beams are better than one!](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3452296.3472924). This code will help you understand analog multi-beamforming for blockage resilience and almost doubling the throughput through constructive combining.

3. [mmFlexible](https://github.com/ucsdwcsng/dpa): Code for Infocom'23 paper on a new mmWave antenna array architecture called delay-phased array]() to address resource distribution problem in mmWave. With this new architecture, time-frequency resources can be optimally distributed to multiple users with frequency-dependent multi-beamforming.

4. [Stochastic Geometry](https://github.com/ishjain/mmwave): Code for IEEE JSAC 2019 paper that models multi-connectivity with many base stations in rural and urban areas with buildings to study the impact of mobile blockers on throughput, latency, and coverage. You can use this simulator to verify mathematical bounds based on stochastic geometry.
